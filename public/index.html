<p>We are here to help you and your family with your US Immigration forms if you do not have
access to a lawyer. If you have access to a lawyer to help you with your forms, please exit
this site and consult them instead. Your chances of being granted protection will be much
higher if you consult a lawyer first.</p>
<p>There are some other important points to note before you decide to fill out this form.</p>
<p>
<ul>

<li>To qualify for asylum, you must establish that you are a refugee who is unable or unwilling to
return to his or her country of nationality, or last habitual residence if you have no nationality,
because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,
nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. This means that you
must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or
political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for your persecution or why you fear
persecution.</li>
<li>If you are granted asylum, you and any eligible spouse or child included in your application
can remain and work in the United States and may eventually adjust to lawful permanent
resident status.</li>
<li>You may apply for asylum irrespective of your immigration status and even if you are in the
United States unlawfully unless otherwise provided by statute or regulations.</li>
<li>You must submit an application for asylum within 1 year of arriving in the United States,
unless there are changed circumstances that materially affect your eligibility for asylum or
extraordinary circumstances directly related to your failure to file within 1 year.</li>
<li>You may include in your application your spouse and unmarried children who are under 21
years of age and physically present in the United States. You must submit certain documents
for your spouse and each child included as required by these instructions. Children 21 years of
age or older and married children must file separate applications. If you are granted asylum
and your spouse and/or any unmarried children under 21 years of age are outside the United
States, you may file Form I-730, Refugee and Asylee Relative Petition, for them to gain similar
benefits.</li>
<li>If you are under 18 and coming to the US with no parent or legal guardian in the United States,
DO NOT FILL OUT THIS FORM, you must contact the Office of Refugee Resettlement that
can help you become part of the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors Program (URM).</li>
<li>There is no filing fee for this application.</li></p>
